#summary Describes the class handling the display of jdialogs.

= Introduction =

The dialog manager is used to handle the lifecycle of JDialogs that are controlled by modules. It shows/hides the dialogs if the controller is (de)activated and closes them if the controller is closed.

It currently supports three display modes
  * *Application Modal* - The dialog is always on top and the whole application is blocked until the dialog is closed.
  * *Modul Modal* - The dialog is always on top. The module is blocked but not the application.
  * *Non Modal* - The dialog could be moved to the background. The application is not blocked. 

= How To =

== How to open a dialog within a controller ==

The only thing you have to do to open a dialog from a controller is to call the showDialog-Method.
{{{
   // Open your dialog.
   Ulrice.getDialogManager().showDialog(this, dialog, DialogMode.ModuleModal);
}}}
